We respect your privacy. This application only collects Instagram message content sent to our business account in order to automatically respond with relevant answers or follow-up.

We do not sell or share user data with third parties.

We do not collect or store personal identifiers beyond what Meta provides for messaging (e.g. sender ID and message text).

Messages are processed in real-time and not retained beyond their use in automation workflows.
